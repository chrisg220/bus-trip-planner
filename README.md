This app allows a user to monitor the "on-time-ness" of journeys they take on Seattle public transit (ex. daily commutes) by regularly checking the real-time transit data provided by One Bus Away in a window that matches the route-stop-time of when the user typically takes the journey.

The app collects this data and determines if the bus actually arrived or departed early, late or on-time (based on it's scheduled time). As it builds up historical data for this route-stop-time, it can better predict the behavior of this bus at this stop at this time.

For multi-leg trips, the app will also determine if there is enough predicted transfer time (as suggested by Google transit directions) between legs, or if the historical performance of the bus on each leg will interfere with the user completing their anticipated journey.

By presenting this aggregated information in a visual way to the user, she can make better judgements about the routes she takes on public transit.
